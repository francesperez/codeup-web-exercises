How do you find out what's wrong when you have 80 million lines of code?
Would you just comment it out? Would you search through every single line to find the mistake?
The answer is to write tests for every single unit to make sure everything works fine.
By the book, you write the tests first, that way when you run the tests, you can keep track of your progress when the
tests pass.
